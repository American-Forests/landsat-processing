# landsat-processing
A notebook that details how we process our landsat data to derive temperature and ultimately a heat index! Note: this script version is in a single-threaded jupyter notebook to make it more portable, I outlined where to multi-process and multi-thread to get a speed boost.

## Speed Boost

- Mutli-Thread the data download process
- Multi-Process the data processing steps
